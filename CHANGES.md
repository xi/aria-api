0.4.6 (2023-01-08)
------------------

-	fix: `img[alt=""]` has role presentation
-	fix handling of whitespace in some places (but still not perfect)
-	only treat direct children of `<details>` as hidden. This is consistent with
	how `display: none` is treated.


0.4.5 (2022-10-10)
------------------

-	fix a typo in the previous release


0.4.4 (2022-10-10)
------------------

-	use labels property as indicator that element is labelable
-	fix issue with non-labelable elements inside label elements


0.4.3 (2022-10-04)
------------------

-	treat children of `<details>` as hidden
-	avoid infinite loops with `aria-owns` (thanks to Jon Ribbens)


0.4.2 (2022-01-25)
------------------

-	assume separator is not focussable (i.e. structure, not widget)
-	fix nameFromContents for cell
-	fix: treat aria-hidden as bool-undefined
-	fix: escape ids before inserting them into selectors


0.4.1 (2021-06-23)
------------------

-	always ignore `<noscript>` elements


0.4.0 (2020-09-10)
------------------

-	use browser API `HTMLInputElement.labels` instead of own implementation
-	expose previously internal functions `getParentNode()` and `getChildNodes()`


0.3.0 (2019-05-23)
------------------

-	new module atree for walking the accessibility tree. The tree is takes
	`aria-owns` into account. Elements with `aria-hidden` are skipped.
-	new module attrs contains some functions that were previously part of query.
-	there is no longer a minified dist file.

-	attrs: `aria.getAttribute(el, 'hidden')` no longer checks the ancestor
	elements, only the element itself
-	attrs: support implicit attribute values for roles
-	attrs: a form element now also gets the role "form" if it has a `title`
	attribute
-	attrs: the `hidden` attribute is no longer considered to imply `aria-hidden`.
	Instead, the implication is indirect via `display`. See
	<https://github.com/w3c/html-aam/issues/178>.
-	attrs: elements like header or footer only get implicit roles if they are not
	scoped. The scoping detection has been fixed to include not only sectioning
	content but also sectioning roots (e.g. blockquote).
-	name: the code to detect recursion has been changed, hopefully for the
	better.
